Cute and small game launcher I made for friends.

Mostly using it right now to play test our game and push updates very quickly.

PocketBase endpoint currently hardcoded but publishing credentials are in `.env`

I could update the code and release instructions to self host. 

### Features

- Uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) on Linux and Windows
- Auto updating launcher, and games update in realtime
- Add games without making launcher builds

I'm also publishing game builds to PocketBase using scripts in Unity but they're not open source right now.
